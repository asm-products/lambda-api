## TriviaCrack/Duolingo for Developers

We are what would happen if TriviaCrack and duolingo had a geeky baby.
This product is being built with love by the Assembly community.

## Contributing & Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/asm-products/lambda-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for instructions on how to set up your development environment and start contributing.

If you ignore [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/asm-products/lambda-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
, you're going to have a bad time.

## Other Repos

This repo is dedicated to the development of Lambda's backend API. We (will) have a
seperate repo for the web front-end (Ember.js) and ios codebases.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
